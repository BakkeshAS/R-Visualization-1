# R-Visualization-1
Visualizations using R
## Problem Statement
In this project there are three sections Part 1, 2, and 3. 

### Part 1 
require me to get data from https://data.gov.ie/ and for a perticular feature, build a basic histogram in R Studio, vizualize using both R base graphics and GGPLOT2. Using same dataset represent another feature as scatter plot(R base graphics & GGPLOT2 with colours).

### Part 2 
data is available in this repository, using Customer Spend data plot a time series analysis using R basic graphics and any other R function.

### Part 3 
Choose an Irish county and look up the names and co-ordinates (easting, northing) of the towns in that county. Â Create a visual using R in which the town names (or abbreviations of certain town names) are placed on a map according to their co-ordinates. Make this a professional-looking picture.
